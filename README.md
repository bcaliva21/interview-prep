## Linked Lists
  - 206. Reverse Linked List
    - Success
    - February 12
    - Notes: use current, previous, temp to reassign node pointers
  - 92. Reverse Linked List II
    - Failure
      - watched neetcode to study
    - February 12
    - Notes: use dummyNode to avoid edge cases, three step process
      - find left position
      - reverse from left position to right position
      - reconcile broken list using leftPrevious.next.next and leftPrevious.next
  - 141. Linked List Cycle
    - Success
    - February 12
    - Notes: fast and slow pointer (Floyd's Cycle Detection) 
      - move pointers before evaluating slow === fast
  - 142. Linked List Cycle II
    - Success
    - February 12
    - Notes: fast and slow pointer (Floyd's Cycle Detection)
      - after a cycle is determined, increment headPointer and fastPointer by one'
      - when these pointers meet, you have found the cycle starting point
  - 160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists
    - Failure
      - missed the while loop conditional
    - February 12
    - Notes: use two pointers to iterate through each list
      - when a pointer reaches the end of it's list, assign it to the other list head
      - when the pointers match, then break the loop, return either pointer
  - 234. Palidrome Linked List
    - Failure
      - compared ListNode's INSTEAD of comparing values
    - February 12
    - Notes: Three step process
      - find mid (Floyd's Cycle Detection)
      - reverse mid to end
      - compare head VALUES to mid VALUES
  - 328. Odd Even Linked List
    - Failure
      - watched a few YouTube videos and solved again
    - February 12
    - Notes: two pointers, go slow and logically assign the nodes with O(n) time complexity
  - 2095. Delete the Middle Node of a Linked List
    - Success
    - February 12
    - Notes: Use the Floyd Cycle Detection to find ONE BEFORE mid
      - remove the middle node using ONE BEFORE mid
  - 86. Partition List
    - Success
    - February 12
    - Notes: Collect values into left and right dummy Lists
      - point left list to head of right list
      - set right list tail to point to null to remove list cycle
  - 2487. Remove Nodes from Linked List
    - Failure
      - watched neetcode
    - February 12
    - Notes: Reverse the list and keep track of max
      - if value is not gte max, then remove it from list
      - when returning the list, do not forget to reverse it again
      - a reverse helper function is very helpful here!
